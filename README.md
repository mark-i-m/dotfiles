config-files
============
Contains various Linux config files

Some are based on other's config files

vim:
- tagbar: requires Exuberant ctags
- vim-airline: requires airline fonts
- YCM: requires clang and has a compiled part

run ./install to copy the config files to their places, some downloading of vim pluggins will happen. backup the old copies beforehand, since they will be overwritten.
